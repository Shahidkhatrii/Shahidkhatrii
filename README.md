# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mo. Shahid Khatri

Final Year Electronics and Communication Student | Aspiring Software Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a final year student pursuing Electronics and Communication engineering with a passion for software development. I'm currently focused on honing my skills in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to build exciting and innovative projects.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Developing web applications using the MERN stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced React patterns, GraphQL, and server optimization.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Open-source projects and software development initiatives.
- 💬 Ask me about: Anything related to software development, MERN stack, and electronics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Here are some technologies and tools I'm familiar with:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Version Control: Git
- Tools: VS Code, Postman, npm

## 📚 Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on:

1. **Contact Manager App**: Developed a fully functional MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) contact manager application with user
authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing contacts efficiently.
   - **Tech Stack**: React.js, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Semantic UI
   - **Description**: Implemented secure user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user
sessions, ensuring data privacy and security.
• Utilized Axios for seamless API integration, simplifying HTTP requests and responses between the front-end and
back-end of the contact manager app.
• Employed React’s Context API to manage state and data flow efficiently, eliminating the need for prop drilling and
ensuring a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
• Successfully deployed the MERN contact manager Web service and Static site on Render.
• [Contact Manager App](https://contacts-manager-afev.onrender.com/)
